    Your code goes between the two comment blocks.
    Do not edit anything outside of this section.

    You are playing the game Mancala. Rules for
    Mancala can be found here:
    https://endlessgames.com/wp-content/uploads/Mancala_Instructions.pdf

    Each time your code runs it will be selecting
    what space to pick for one turn of the game.

    The board variable contains a two dimensional array.
    The array is 6 x 2. To access the values of the array
    you can use the variable like so:
    board[x][y]

    In the above scenrio x would be replaced with a
    number between 0 and 5. And y would be replaced
    with a number between 0 and 1

    The x value traverses the board from left to
    right across the six spaces.

    The y value chooses between your side of the
    board and your opponents. 0 is your side of the
    board. 1 is your opponents.

    The player_1_score and player_2_score variables
    containt the current score for each player.

    You are player 1.

    You must return a value between 0 and 5.

    That will abe the space you choose for your turn.

    If you select a number outside that range, you will
    forfeit your turn. You will also forfeit your turn
    if you select a space that is empty.

    #Your code goes here

    choice = 0 # At the end of your code, this variable should have a number between 0 and 5 representing your choice of move
